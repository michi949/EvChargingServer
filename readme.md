# Project - EvChargingServer 
This is a Spring Boot web service and server which is responsible for the management of charging stations to mobile applications. The main task of the server is to optimize several charging stations together in an energy efficient way. A MariaDB is additionally created in a Docker container, for this you can find a suitable Docker-Compose and SQL file.
